Building a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
The project involves :
1. Determining the breed of the dog using CNN and transfer learning
2. Identifying human faces using opencv
3. Distinguishing between a human face and dog face.
4. Algorithm can also take care of mix breed dogs.
5. Algorithm will add snapchat dog ear filter on human faces encountered in an image.
